# LRS
LRS (last rose of summer) is a website that was created with the intent of being used on a data base, that would be storing information about guitars. I ended up liking the visual so much that I decided I would turn it into a personal project. Currently the site is very basic and lacks a lot of things, that I will be adding throughout time. If you have any recomendations feel free to share them with me. This is probably my first personal project, so as you might know I lack a lot of knowledge about basically everything.
