# LRS
LRS (Last Rose of Summer) began as a simple school project
made because my previous teacher was a PDF file and didn't 
teach us (never touched us too gladly). Since I never had 
to make a site from the start, I got a bit too hyped and 
made something a bit more complex than it should've been.
That's how LRS appeared in the first place. Than I thought,
why not turn it into a ~~mockup-ish of a guitar store~~ f-ing amalgamation with everything I like? And currently
that's the main objective of the website. It lacks a lot of things,
and if you read my code you'll probably wish I never learnt how to code, but 
at least I'm open to suggestions (please share them :)
