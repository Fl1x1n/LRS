                <p>
                    Last Rose of Summer is an online guitar store, founded in 2024 by Me. The idea came to life after I
                    began
                    playing electric guitar. Due to my passion for both the guitar and coding, I decided to mix both
                    things in some
                    sort of way. The code is not optimized at all, and a lot of things that I know has been thaught by
                    the man itself
                    ReduxFlakes. In consideration for him, I decided to dedicate a small portion of my site to one of
                    his projects,
                    Surfscape. Please visit his site once you're done with mine. (Please take into consideration that
                    this Website
                    is a mockup, so I'm not in fact selling guitars. Maybe one day ðŸ˜Š).</p>

                    Please note that this guitars are just a recommendation, each guitar player should visit a real
                    store and test to
                    see which one suits him the best. Different guitars have different hardware and profiles, that are
                    made for distinct
                    genres and people. And remember, always stick with the guitar that you like, either expensive or
                    cheap.
