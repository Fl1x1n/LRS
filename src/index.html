            <p>
            Last Rose of Summer is an online guitar store, founded in 2024 by Me. The idea came to life after I began
            playing electric guitar. Due to my passion for both the guitar and coding, I decided to mix both things in some
            sort of way. The code is not optimized at all, and a lot of things that I know has been thaught by the man itself
            ReduxFlakes. In consideration for him, I decided to dedicate a small portion of my site to one of his projects,
            Surfscape. Please visit his site once you're done with mine. (Please take into consideration that this Website
            is a mockup, so I'm not in fact selling guitars. Maybe one day ðŸ˜Š).</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Here you can see what models we recommend for different audiences, ranging from begginers to professional guitarists.
                Please note that this guitars are just a recommendation, each guitar player should visit a real store and test to 
                see which one suits him the best. Different guitars have different hardware and profiles, that are made for distinct
                genres and people. And remember, always stick with the guitar that you like, either expensive or cheap.
