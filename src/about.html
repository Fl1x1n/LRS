                <p> LRS or Last Rose of Summer came to be due to a small problem we had on my school.
                    For a bit of context, I'm doing computer science and my teacher that thaught us
                    HTML, CSS and JS didn't really do shit during classes. Later we found out that
                    he was a PDF File that recorded underage students and jerked of to those videos...during
                    classes (yikes). One of our teachers needed to theach us PHP, and we kinda needed some
                    bases that we didn't have because the other guy was busy <s>beating his meat during classes</s>
                    staring at the computer screen doing nothing.</p>
                <p> So our teacher demanded that we created a site from scratch that could be used with a database.
                    Turns out I got so hyped that I decided to make something quite complex (compared to other
                    students websites). Time passed by and I kept thinking to myself "damn that website has
                    potential". It was my first real project made from scratch so I poured my knowledge into it.
                    Then, I did some changes and with the help of my friend ReduxFlakes I posted my very first
                    website on neocities, and here we Are!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course posting it on neocities requiered some changes, so the site got quite remodeled
                    and adapted since I won't be using PHP (just check the first version via commits) and so far
                    I've added a lot of things (considering the time I have to work on my personal projects).
                </p>

                <h1 class="abt">Name</h1>

                <p> The name didn't really had much thought put into it. "Oh I like the song The Last Rose of Summer
                    from Judas Priest. Let's name my site after that song!" and that's quite it.
                </p>
                <h1 class="abt">Other info</h1>

                <p> The website is a mockup-ish of a guitar store for now, but I'm already changing it to look
                    more like a "conglomerate" of things I like, mainly music for now. At the end of everything
                    it's just really something I made for fun and to share a bit of my knowledge and things I like.
                    Any suggestions are welcome to be shared!
                </p>
