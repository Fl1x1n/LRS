                <p> 
                    Hello fella! My name is Flixin or Fl1x1n (numbers make it sound more cool). Currently I'm 17
                    years old and studying computer science. I don't really know what I should be writing here, but 
                    I'll try to make it sound interesting.
                </p>
                <h3 class="abt" style="--color-one: hsl(112, 100%, 76%);--color-two: hsl(109, 100%, 38%);">Things I enjoy</h3>
                <p> 
                    I end up enjoying a lot of things. My main idea was to become a car mechanic but due to some 
                    problems with the school that teaches it I decided to go for computer science instead. 
                    That ended up resulting in a amalgamation named Fl1x1n. I also love music a lot and ended up
                    buying a guitar. My journey on the guitar has been quite bumpy to say the least. I decided
                    to buy a guitar with a floyd rose and after 6 months my strings got quite rusty. "Let's try
                    to do it myself!" and that made me spend 60 currencies on a maintenance. Fortunately i didn't 
                    damage anything but I got quite sad and stopped for a while. Recently I've been practicing "daily"
                    but I seem to be stagnant. Maybe I'll find a way to solve my issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also know some things about woodwork and farming since I end up helping my grandmother by plowing
                    using a small tractor and my father when he has work on weekends. I'll try to make a personal website
                    in the future to make things better (with the intent of only talking about me).
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Currently I don't have a car yet, but I'm planning on buying a fiat 127 and restoring it. It
                    was my father's first car and it has special meaning to me since I wanted to bring some of the 
                    old days to my father (and also because I love old carburated cars). The car is <s>completely
                    fucked</s> in a bit of a rough shape (matching my wallet) but I really don't want to give up 
                    on him. Even if I buy another car once I have money I'll buy the fiat 127 because Italy and 
                    Carburetor.

                <p> 
                    I thought it would be a nice idea to share some of my equipment here.
