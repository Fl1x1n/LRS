                <p>The SG format, or "Solid Guitar," is a renowned electric guitar design first 
                    introduced by Gibson in 1961. Known for its sleek, double-cutaway body shape,
                     the SG is celebrated for its lightweight feel and incredible playability. 
                     The guitar typically features a solid mahogany body and neck, contributing 
                     to its warm and resonant tone, while the carved top adds a touch of elegance.

                    Equipped with two powerful humbucking pickups, the SG delivers a rich
                     and versatile sound that can easily transition from heavy rock to bluesy tones.
                      Its shorter scale length and smooth neck profile make it comfortable for fast
                       playing and intricate solos.
                    
                    The SG has been famously associated with iconic guitarists such as Angus Young 
                    of AC/DC, Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath, and Derek Trucks, further cementing its 
                    status in rock and metal history. With its distinctive design, powerful sound,
                    and deep-rooted legacy, the SG format remains a favorite among guitarists of
                     all styles.</p>
