                <h1>Les Paul</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>The Les Paul format refers to a classic style of electric guitar originally designed
                     by Gibson, famously associated with the legendary guitarist Les Paul. Introduced
                      in 1952, the Les Paul guitar features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple 
                      top, providing a rich, warm tone and excellent sustain. Known for its 
                      single-cutaway design, it typically includes two powerful humbucking pickups that 
                      deliver a thick, creamy sound, making it a favorite in rock, blues, and jazz 
                      genres.

                    The Les Paul format is recognized for its comfortable playability and aesthetic 
                    appeal, often adorned with elegant finishes and binding. Renowned players like
                     Jimmy Page, Slash, and Eric Clapton have made the Les Paul their instrument of 
                     choice, contributing to its legendary status in the music world. Whether used for
                      heavy distortion or smooth, clean tones, the Les Paul continues to be a symbol 
                      of musical excellence and innovation.</p>

                <p>Additional Info: The average weight of a Les Paul is
                     5 kilograms (11lb in freedom units). Not much? Try playing for one hour, standing 
                    and your shoulder will most definitely say the opposite :) </p>
