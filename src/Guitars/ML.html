                <p>The Dean ML is a striking electric guitar known for its bold design and powerful 
                    sound, making it a favorite among rock and metal guitarists. Introduced in the 
                    1970s by Dean Guitars, the ML features an aggressive, asymmetrical body shape that 
                    not only stands out visually but also enhances playability and comfort.

                    Typically constructed with a solid mahogany body and a set neck, the ML 
                    delivers rich, warm tones and impressive sustain. Equipped with high-output 
                    humbucking pickups, it excels at producing thick, dynamic sounds suitable for 
                    heavy distortion and aggressive playing styles.
                    
                    The ML has been embraced by numerous influential guitarists, including Dimebag 
                    Darrell of Pantera, who helped popularize the model in the metal scene. With its 
                    distinctive looks, exceptional performance capabilities, and association with 
                    legendary musicians, the Dean ML continues to be a sought-after choice for players 
                    looking to make a statement on stage.</p>
