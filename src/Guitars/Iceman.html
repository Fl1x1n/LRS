                <p>The Iceman is a distinctive electric guitar model produced by Ibanez, known for its unique
                     body shape and versatile sound. Originally introduced in the 1970s, it features a
                      double-cutaway design with a flat top and sharp angles, giving it a modern aesthetic 
                      that stands out on stage. The Iceman is favored by rock and metal guitarists for its 
                      powerful humbucking pickups, smooth playability, and comfortable neck profile. Notably 
                      associated with guitarist Paul Stanley of KISS and later with artists like Joe Satriani 
                      and Rob Caggiano, the Iceman offers a wide tonal range, making it suitable for various 
                      musical styles, from hard rock to progressive metal. Its combination of striking visuals
                       and exceptional performance capabilities has made it a beloved choice among players.</p>
