                <p>The Flying V is an iconic electric guitar known for its distinctive, futuristic shape
                     resembling a flying "V." Originally designed by Gibson in 1958, it gained 
                     popularity in the late 1960s and 1970s, particularly in rock and heavy metal music.
                      Renowned for its powerful sound and sustain, the Flying V features a solid body, 
                      dual humbucking pickups, and a sleek neck design, making it a favorite among 
                      guitarists like Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and Dave Mustaine. Its striking 
                      appearance and bold performance capabilities have solidified its status as a 
                      symbol of rock 'n' roll culture.</p>
