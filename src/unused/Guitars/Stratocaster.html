                <p>The Stratocaster format, created by Fender in 1954, is one of the most iconic electric 
                    guitar designs in music history. Renowned for its contoured body shape and comfortable 
                    playability, the Stratocaster features a double-cutaway design that allows easy access to
                     higher frets. Made primarily from solid woods like alder or ash, it offers a balanced 
                     tone with a strong midrange presence.

                    The Stratocaster is equipped with three single-coil pickups, providing a bright, clear 
                    sound with excellent articulation. Its versatile pickup switching system enables players 
                    to explore a wide range of tonal options, making it suitable for genres ranging from rock 
                    and blues to country and jazz.
                    
                    Iconic musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan have 
                    famously wielded the Stratocaster, contributing to its legendary status. With its
                     combination of innovative design, tonal versatility, and cultural significance, 
                     the Stratocaster continues to be a preferred choice for guitarists around the world.</p>

                    get sold out in 24H in Portugal recently *sobs*. Yeah uh Dave Murray plays on the same
                    white strat since he joined the band.
