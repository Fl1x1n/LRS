                <p>Guitars in the LTD 1000 Series are designed to offer the tone, feel, looks, and quality
                    that working professional musicians need in an instrument. The Arrow-1000NT stands for
                    “non-tremolo”, delivering this bold and angular guitar shape with a recessed TonePros TOM
                    bridge and string-thru-body design. It offers a neck-thru-body design with mahogany body,
                    3-piece maple neck, reverse headstock, and Macassar ebony fingerboard with triangular
                    white pearloid inlays. Designed to provide the tones for modern rock and metal, the
                    Arrow-1000NT features a set of direct-mount Fishman Fluence Modern Humbucker active
                    pickups (alnico in the neck and ceramic in the bridge), with push-pull control to select
                    voicings. These pickups offer an outstanding variety of huge tones that range from
                    aggressive and punchy to smooth and articulate. The Arrow-1000NT also includes
                    stainless steel frets and precise LTD locking tuners.</p>
