            <h2 class="titles">Egitana</h2>
            <p>Based in Portugal, Egitana offers a wide range of music equipment, such as
              guitars, pedals, audio interfaces, drum kits, accessories and more. Egitana
              is the largest music store in Portugal and has gained a lot of popularity throughout
              time. Actually bought my guitar here and so far they have done an amazing job with the
              periodic maintenance. Cons? The website lacks a bit in design, but that's just my personal
              opinion. Please note that the website won't load if you live outside Portugal. Instead click on
              <a class="links-hover" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Egitana">this</a> to visit their oficial youtube
              channel.

            <h2 class="titles">Thomann</h2>
            <p>Thomann is a music equipment store, created in Germany. Recently the store has
              reached their 70th anniversary, proving it's big longevity.
              On Thomann the customer can find basically anything music related. Intruments,
              amplifiers, mics, cabinets, etc. The only "problem" is the delivery time, but considering
              they ship throughout Europe I think it's absolutely fair.

            <h2 class="titles">Sweetwater</h2>
            <p>Based in the US, we heard the store is quite famous and respected.
              They have a nice guitar catalog. The only thing that lacks in my opinion
              is the guitar separation. Other sites are more specific in the categorization,
              like stratocaster, double cut, single cut, heavy, etc. On Sweetwater is quite
              worse.
