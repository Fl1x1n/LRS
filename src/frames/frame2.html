            a classic, with songs like "Breaking the Law" and "Living After Midnight" becoming 
            anthems for the genre. Throughout their career, they've released numerous iconic albums
             such as Screaming for Vengeance (1982) and Painkiller (1990), each showcasing their

            sold over 50 million records worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
            Fame in 2022, solidifying their status as metal icons.</p>
